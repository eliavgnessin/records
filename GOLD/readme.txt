Quick installation for the goldshmidt project

To quickly install and run the project at home, what you'll have to do is to put the 3 files I included here at the root directory of your C drive (i.e. C:\).

After you've put the files, just double click the Project1.EXE file, to execute the GUI.

If this doesn't work, or you get a "Path not found" error after the execution, just double click the FINAL.MWS file in the C:\ directory, to execute the MAPLE file.

This installation method assumes that you have the VB runtime installed on your home computer. I'll send you another mail with a full installation.
